# MVP

- explain the principles from the chapter
- style blockquotes and page subtitle

# things to poke at

- a transition when switching between date ranges would be nice
	- would need to pass in minX/maxX/minY/maxY values
	- minsAndMaxes should only consider values within that range
	- every data point and tick should have a css transition on their xs and ys
