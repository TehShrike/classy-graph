- display the axis labels
- data points should be considered hovered as soon as the cursor is within the hover size radius, not the data point radius
	- or maybe: if no hover indicator is under the mouse cursor, but the mouse cursor is within ~10px or so of a data point, take whichever data point is closest to the cursor and consider it hovered
- set opacities on ticks and data points
	- make the default tick size larger
- another example graph
	- strength of USD/GBP/EUR over time
	- will need to handle multiple datasets
	- big mac index data: https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data
- use groups to apply strokes and fills to data points and ticks
- explain the principles from the chapter
